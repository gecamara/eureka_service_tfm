# üÖøÔ∏è PK4U: Parking for You - Eureka Server



## üöÄ Local Deployment

To run the Eureka service locally, you will need to have its dependency ecosystem active.

### **üìã Prerequisites**

-   **JDK 21** (or the version specified in the `pom.xml`).
-   **Maven** or **Gradle** for dependency management and project building.

### **1. Clone the Repository ‚¨áÔ∏è**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/gecamara/eureka_service_tfm.git](https://github.com/gecamara/eureka_service_tfm.git)
cd eureka_service_tfm
```

### 2. Environment Setup üõ†Ô∏è
The application's configuration is managed in the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file. Ensure that the connection properties are correct for your local environment.

### 3. Running the Application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
You can run the application using the Maven or Gradle plugin.

With Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

With Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### 4. Running the Full System üåê
Keep in mind that the frontend is only the **presentation layer** of the PK4U system. for full functionality, you need to have all the backend services running.

Make sure to clone and run the following repositories in the recommended order:

| Order | Component             | Description                                                                                          | Repository                                                                    |

## üåü What is PK4U?

In modern cities, finding parking has become a daily challenge that causes stress and unnecessarily increases traffic and pollution. This phenomenon, known as _cruising for parking_, negatively affects the quality of life and urban sustainability.

**PK4U** was created to address this problem by offering an open-source solution that centralizes and displays real-time parking availability in a city. Our platform unifies data from multiple parking facilities into a single interface with interactive maps, empowering drivers to make better decisions and contributing to smarter, more sustainable mobility.
